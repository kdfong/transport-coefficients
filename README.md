# Computing Transport Coefficients from Molecular Dynamics

This code uses output files from LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations to compute Onsager transport coefficients in electrolyte solutions. There are two methods to do so. The first method, in the 'integrate-acf' folder, uses the velocities of the ions and is based on integrating (auto)correlation functions with respect to time. The second method, in the 'einstein' folder, uses Einstein relations, which compute the transport coefficients based on the positions or mean-square displacements. The two methods are mathematically equivalent, but typically the former requires more frequent sampling and the latter requires longer total simulation run time.

Each folder contains a Jupyter notebook with the equations used for the calculation as well as instructions for preparing the input files from LAMMPS simulations. Example simulation data for each method, along with the output files that should be generated from running the example code, are included.  The first method ('integrate-acf') has an example of atomistic simulations of LiCl in dimethyl sulfoxide; simulation details can be found in http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16164. The second method ('einstein') computes transport coefficients for coarse-grained simulations of polyelectrolyte solutions (manuscript in preparation).
