# Computing Transport Coefficients from Molecular Dynamics

This code uses output files from LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations to compute Onsager transport coefficients in electrolyte solutions. For the equations used for the calculation as well as instructions for preparing the input files from LAMMPS simulations, see the notebook "Example  L_ij Calculations.ipynb" in the example_calculation folder. This example computes transport coefficients for a simple system of LiCl in dimethyl sulfoxide (simulation details can be found in http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16164) and also shows how to use the computed transport coefficients to compute ionic conductivity. The output files which should be generated from the example are in the folder example_output.
